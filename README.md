# From High School Arithmetic to Group Cohomology

I taught this course Mathcamp 2019. 
It is based on a fun paper by Dan Isaken called [A cohomological viewpoint of elementary school arithmetic](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072368?seq=1). 
The course introduces the notions of group extensions and exact sequences as a way of interpreting addition of multi-digit numbers. 
The course is designed in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.
The prerequisites are group theory.
